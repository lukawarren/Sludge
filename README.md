# Sludge
A "sort-of" MUD written in modern C++, by someone who is too young to have ever even played one.

## Why the name?
Sludge is ill-defined, hard to grasp and lacks structure (literally).

Uses [Ruputeless's Perlin Noise library](https://github.com/Reputeless/PerlinNoise).
Names from the [Moby Word List by Gary Ward](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3201).
