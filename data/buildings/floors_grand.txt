The floor's marble shines brilliantly, reflecting its surroundings.
You almost feel guilty covering the intricate mosaics with your feet.

A checkered pattern adorns the floor.
The floor's pristine marble is interrupted only by strips of another polished stone, which radiate outwards from a central point.
