Moss grows from every crevice.
You run your finger along the rock and feel a slight moisture.
By what little light their is, you fumble around.
Who knows what these rocky walls have seen?
Time has, it seems, eroded the more angular features.
There is a surprising amount of life dwelling here: mushrooms and mysterious greenery give you food for thought.
Arches loom above, with stalactites suspended precariously.
You wonder what would happen if a sudden explosion sealed the enterance.
It is strange, though not surprising, that you have to squint to make out the more subtle details among the shadows.
